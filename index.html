                    ir para o lixo comum, seus materiais viram novas matérias-primas, ajudando o meio ambiente.</p>

                <p>Chamamos de “lixo eletrônico” tudo o que não usamos mais, como celulares e cabos. Mas, na verdade,
                    muitos desses itens ainda podem ser reciclados ou reaproveitados. O termo mais correto é resíduo
                    eletrônico, pois mostra que eles ainda têm valor e podem ajudar o meio ambiente e a economia.</p>

                <h3>Perigo Real (Desmontagem)</h3>
                <p>
                    Não é recomendado desmontar seus aparelhos em casa, pois isso pode ser perigoso e dificultar a
                    reciclagem. O desmonte deve ser feito por profissionais qualificados. Para baterias de lítio, como
                    as de celulares, mantenha-as dentro do dispositivo ou embale-as de forma segura antes de descartar.
                    Equipamentos maiores devem ser entregues inteiros aos pontos de coleta.

                <h3>Objetivo Principal</h3>
                <p>
                    O desafio do lixo eletrônico exige uma abordagem sistêmica, integrando ações de governos, empresas,
                    instituições de ensino e consumidores. Soluções sustentáveis vão além da reciclagem: elas buscam
                    reestruturar a forma como produzimos, consumimos e descartamos tecnologia. A seguir, apresentamos um
                    conjunto de estratégias interligadas para enfrentar esse problema de forma eficaz e duradoura:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Produtos modulares, com peças que podem ser trocadas, e o uso de materiais recicláveis ou
                    biodegradáveis ajudam a reduzir o impacto ambiental. A Fairphone, por exemplo, fabrica celulares
                    fáceis de consertar, promovendo mais durabilidade.
                </p>
                <h3 class="tituloMenor marginTop">Economia Circular</h3>
                <p>
                    Na economia circular, o foco é reaproveitar. Em vez de simplesmente descartar, reutiliza-se
                    aparelhos, recuperam-se metais valiosos e reintegram-se materiais reciclados nas cadeias produtivas.
                    Isso diminui a extração de recursos e a geração de lixo.
                </p>
                <h3 class="tituloMenor marginTop">Logística Reversa</h3>
                <p>
                    A logística reversa garante que os produtos usados voltem ao fabricante, que deve dar a eles um
                    destino adequado. Isso inclui pontos de coleta, programas de troca e campanhas de recolhimento —
                    medidas já previstas por lei no Brasil.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="card">
                <h3 class="tituloMenor">Educação Ambiental e Conscientização</h3>
                <p>
                    Informar consumidores sobre o impacto do consumo e descarte faz toda a diferença. Reparar,
                    reutilizar e comprar de forma consciente são atitudes que reduzem o lixo eletrônico.
                </p>
                <h3 class="tituloMenor marginTop">Incentivo à Pesquisa e Inovação</h3>
                <p>
                    Investir em reciclagem eficiente, novos materiais e tecnologias de rastreamento torna todo o
                    processo mais limpo e inteligente.
